Guidelines:
1. Paragraph Structure:

   - Include ALL patient data naturally
   - Bold key medical terms using Markdown

2. Question Requirements:
   - Generate 2-5 questions per paragraph
   - Use incremental IDs (q1, q2, q3)
   - Questions should clarify details and identify symptom clusters

{{
  "paragraphs": [
    {{
      "key": "pain_description",
      "content": "I've experienced **sharp pain** in my **right shoulder**...",
      "questions": [
        {{
