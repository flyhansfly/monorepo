This means the tissues connecting muscle to bone around your shoulder are irritated. This is common in people who repeat the same shoulder motions again and again (like lifting heavy objects at work or during recreational activities).\",\"reasoning\":\"Given the patient's complaint of mild shoulder pain, primarily during physical activity, and relief with rest, stretching, and massage, rotator cuff tendinitis is a likely diagnosis. This is supported by the fact that the patient has difficulty lifting objects, which is a common symptom of this condition.\"},\"other_probabilistic_diagnosis\":[{\"diagnosis\":\"Frozen Shoulder\",\"probability\":0.15,\"icd10_code\":\"M75.0\",\"simple_explanation\":\"You might also have 'Frozen Shoulder,' a condition where your shoulder joint becomes so stiff and painful that it's hard to use. This usually happens when the tissues around your shoulder joint swell, thicken, and tighten.\"},{\"diagnosis\":\"Bursitis\",\"probability\":0.1,\"icd10_code\":\"M75.2\",\"simple_explanation\":\"There's a lesser chance that you have 'Bursitis.' This is when a small fluid-filled sac called a bursa gets inflamed in your shoulder, causing pain.\"}]}", "source": "user_generated"}
